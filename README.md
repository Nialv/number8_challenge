Git PR conventions:
PR structure: <type>(<scope>): <description> ie. git commit -am 'feat(BE): Add Basic structure for Backend.'

Valid types:
feat: Introduces a new feature to the codebase.
fix: Fixes a bug in your codebase.
chore: updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change.
refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature.
# docker-compose for code dockerization.

This application run over dockerization.

docker-compose up --build : In case there's any chage applied to the docker-compose file.
docker-compose build --no-cache: run docker compose to clear cache.
docker-compose down -v: remove existing volumes.
Code Structure: (MVC)
Backend:
src/
database : knex configuration file, migrations and seeds.
controllers: main logic to make request to the services sending the information that its expected by the service.
services: additional functionality that process the data sent by the controller and process it so it can be used by the models.
models: functionality that interact directly with the DB.
routes: react-router routes (private / public)
types: typescript interfaces/ types.
utils: other utility functions.
# Frontend:

src/
components: Reusable components of the UI, further divided into:
atoms: Smallest possible components or elements on the page.
layouts: Components that deal with the layout of the page.
molecules: Groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound.
organisms: Groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.
contexts: React contexts for managing state globally across components.
helpers: Utility functions to support various tasks across the application.
hooks: Custom React hooks that encapsulate common logic for reuse in functional components.
interfaces: TypeScript interfaces/types for strong typing of props, state, and other objects.
routes: Definition of react-router routes, likely differentiating between private and public routes.
services: Services for handling external communication, like API calls.
views: The actual rendered pages or screens of the application.
Arquitecture
Frontend -> React on the frontend following an atomic design pattern,
Backend -> Model View Controller pattern with connection to psql with Knex.
Dockerization -> The application follows dockerization patterns to have a more scalable application, and to repare for a posible deployment to production.
